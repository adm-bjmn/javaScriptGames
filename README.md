Learning Java Script basics by building mini games and thinking about the comparisons with python.

Rock Paper Scissors - 13/06/2023
I found this quite a nice way to get started with Java script. Obviously I'm coming from completely different syntax in python but the concepts are translating well.
The approach of the tutorial is a bit unsure, on the one hand its being stated that this is an absolute begginers tutorial but occasionally its assumed that you already have a grasp of the syntax.
Luckily i am folling along well, I've asked Chat GPT to elaborate on a few things and managed to build a slightly nicer and more elegantr version than the one in the tutortial using my
my experience in python and asking chat GPT to translate my concept. I'm concious of the fact that in doing this I have to make absolutely sure I am taking the time to read the syntax thouroughly and learn it and typeing it out rather than copy and paste otherwise I'm never going to learn anything! 
I found that towards the end of this tutorial I was skipping ahead of the video and having to wait for the video to catch up with me when i got a little stuck for syntax. Thats a good sign. 
Tomorrow I'll do another one. 
I like JavaScript. 


Legend of Zelda Memory Game - 15/06/2023
Building the memory game demonstrated to really just how usefull its going to be to know a little bit more about javascript. learning about JS ability to create elements set my mind a racin' with the possibilities this will offer once I get compfortable with it. At this point when I'm thinking broardly about how to mesh Django and JS together and what strengths they bring I'm obvioudsly running into road blocks in my thinking becasue I dont know enough about JS but I'm hoping the further I go into JS as an isolated asset, the more ill be able to make assumptions about its power as a paired one. 
I dont wish that I'd learned JS instead of Python, but I do wish I'd started learning JS sooner.
